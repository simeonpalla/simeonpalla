* Project - Fabrication of _e_-Bike
  * Description
    * Our main interest to take up e bike as our final year project
      is to find better ways of inter-city transportation with less
      harm to the nature and without compromising in comfort.
    * We’ve used a BLDC motor which is simpler in terms of
      maintenance and also cost-effective. We have connected
      batteries that are in the production of Lithium-ion
      technology because of its most popular perks high density,
      easily replaceable, lightweight, long life, etc., which also
      requires less maintenance. To regulate the speed of the
      bike we used ESC (Electronic Speed Controller)
